							<p><strong>Cybersecurity Major - Old Dominion University</strong>
							Hello, my name is Jaeseong Ko, but most of my friends call me Jason. I'm from Fairfax, Virginia and came down to ODU for my degree.
							In Norfolk, I got to experience many different things. As far as my career is concerned, my time at ODU and the people I got to meet made me find interest and appreciation for cybersecurity that I didn't have before.
							Aside from cybersecurity, in my personal life I have interest in learning guitar and training MMA

							<h2>Linux Course Project: Shell Scripting for User Management</h2>
							<p>
								In my Linux course at Old Dominion University, one of the most impactful assignments was creating a shell script to automate user management tasks. 
      The course focused on essential system administration skills including working with the command line, managing users and groups, setting file permissions, 
      and performing basic network configurations. For this assignment, I was required to write a script that could add new users, assign them to specific groups, 
      configure directory permissions, and include error-checking for invalid input. This project simulated real-world system administration responsibilities 
      and helped me understand how automation improves efficiency and consistency in managing Linux-based systems.

								 Through this project, I developed practical skills in shell scripting, system automation, and command-line operations. 
      I also improved my ability to document technical work clearly through script comments and usage instructions. 
      Most importantly, I practiced applying cybersecurity principles such as least privilege and secure system defaults by carefully managing user permissions 
      and error handling. These skills are crucial for roles in cybersecurity, where preventing misconfigurations and reducing manual error are key to maintaining 
      secure environments. This assignment also reinforced my attention to detail and critical thinking, which are essential values in both cybersecurity 
      and system administration.

    <h2>Intro to Cybersecurity</h2>
    <p>
     CYSE 300 - Intro to Cybersecurity offered me a comprehensive overview of the foundational pillars of information security. 
    The course moved through critical topics such as risk management, cryptography, threat modeling, and contingency planning. 
    A standout experience from this course was Lab #7 and Lab #8, which focused on Security Operations and Administration. 
    These labs challenged me to simulate managing a secure environment, respond to common operational issues, and apply layered defense strategies. 
    Working through realistic scenarios allowed me to connect theory to practice and gave me a more tangible grasp of how organizations maintain an ongoing security posture in dynamic IT environments.

	    Completing Labs #7 and #8 pushed me to apply several core cybersecurity skills such as implementing access control measures, 
    performing vulnerability assessments, and understanding the administrative side of secure system maintenance. 
    I gained hands-on experience with security tools and developed my ability to document and communicate security processes clearly â€” 
    an essential skill for professional audits or compliance checks. This experience also reinforced values like 
    discipline, precision, and accountability. 
    These labs strengthened my confidence in working within security operations teams in future career roles.

							<h2>Cyber Law</h2>
							<p>
							This course provided a detailed overview of legal principles relevant to cybersecurity, examining how civil and criminal legal systems apply to digital environments. Topics covered included privacy laws, digital evidence, cybercrime statutes like the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA), and international law frameworks. Emphasis was placed on understanding how legal institutions respond to cyber threats, and how investigators and prosecutors use digital evidence in both domestic and international cases.
I developed a strong understanding of how to interpret and apply cybersecurity laws, analyze legal cases involving cybercrime, and evaluate the legality of government surveillance techniques. I also gained familiarity with constitutional issues such as Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable searches and seizures in digital contexts. Additionally, I strengthened my ability to critically assess cybersecurity policies and international agreements like the Tallinn Manual.

							<h2>Introduction to Philosophy</h2>
							<p>
							This course introduced key philosophical questions and methods through the study of classical and contemporary works. Major themes included knowledge and skepticism, personal identity, free will, and ethics. Readings included Plato, Descartes, Gettier, and Singer, complemented by modern media like *The Matrix* and *Blade Runner* to explore philosophical questions in a broader context.
I learned how to construct clear and logical arguments, critically analyze philosophical texts, and apply abstract reasoning to real-world and hypothetical situations. The course emphasized identifying assumptions, evaluating ethical perspectives, and articulating well-reasoned positions in both written and verbal form.

							<h2>Introduction to Academic Writing</h2>
							<p>
							This course focused on critical thinking, research, and argumentation in academic writing. Students learned how to develop effective rhetorical strategies, analyze audiences, and build structured, evidence-based arguments. The curriculum covered citation styles (MLA), visual rhetoric, and persuasive writing techniques. I developed advanced writing skills including thesis development, source integration, and rhetorical analysis. I also practiced evaluating credibility of sources, conducting scholarly research, and using multimedia tools to support arguments. The course reinforced clarity, organization, and precision in both written and visual communication.
