							<h2>Linux Course Project: Shell Scripting for User Management</h2>
							<p>
								In my Linux course at Old Dominion University, one of the most impactful assignments was creating a shell script to automate user management tasks. 
      The course focused on essential system administration skills including working with the command line, managing users and groups, setting file permissions, 
      and performing basic network configurations. For this assignment, I was required to write a script that could add new users, assign them to specific groups, 
      configure directory permissions, and include error-checking for invalid input. This project simulated real-world system administration responsibilities 
      and helped me understand how automation improves efficiency and consistency in managing Linux-based systems.

								 Through this project, I developed practical skills in shell scripting, system automation, and command-line operations. 
      I also improved my ability to document technical work clearly through script comments and usage instructions. 
      Most importantly, I practiced applying cybersecurity principles such as least privilege and secure system defaults by carefully managing user permissions 
      and error handling. These skills are crucial for roles in cybersecurity, where preventing misconfigurations and reducing manual error are key to maintaining 
      secure environments. This assignment also reinforced my attention to detail and critical thinking, which are essential values in both cybersecurity 
      and system administration.

    <h2>Intro to Cybersecurity</h2>
    <p>
     CYSE 300 - Intro to Cybersecurity offered me a comprehensive overview of the foundational pillars of information security. 
    The course moved through critical topics such as risk management, cryptography, threat modeling, and contingency planning. 
    A standout experience from this course was Lab #7 and Lab #8, which focused on Security Operations and Administration. 
    These labs challenged me to simulate managing a secure environment, respond to common operational issues, and apply layered defense strategies. 
    Working through realistic scenarios allowed me to connect theory to practice and gave me a more tangible grasp of how organizations maintain an ongoing security posture in dynamic IT environments.

	    Completing Labs #7 and #8 pushed me to apply several core cybersecurity skills such as implementing access control measures, 
    performing vulnerability assessments, and understanding the administrative side of secure system maintenance. 
    I gained hands-on experience with security tools and developed my ability to document and communicate security processes clearly — 
    an essential skill for professional audits or compliance checks. This experience also reinforced values like 
    discipline, precision, and accountability. 
    These labs strengthened my confidence in working within security operations teams in future career roles.

							<h2>Cyber Law</h2>
							<p>
							This course provided a detailed overview of legal principles relevant to cybersecurity, examining how civil and criminal legal systems apply to digital environments. Topics covered included privacy laws, digital evidence, cybercrime statutes like the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA), and international law frameworks. Emphasis was placed on understanding how legal institutions respond to cyber threats, and how investigators and prosecutors use digital evidence in both domestic and international cases.
I developed a strong understanding of how to interpret and apply cybersecurity laws, analyze legal cases involving cybercrime, and evaluate the legality of government surveillance techniques. I also gained familiarity with constitutional issues such as Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable searches and seizures in digital contexts. Additionally, I strengthened my ability to critically assess cybersecurity policies and international agreements like the Tallinn Manual.

							<h2>Introduction to Philosophy</h2>
							<p>
							This course introduced key philosophical questions and methods through the study of classical and contemporary works. Major themes included knowledge and skepticism, personal identity, free will, and ethics. Readings included Plato, Descartes, Gettier, and Singer, complemented by modern media like *The Matrix* and *Blade Runner* to explore philosophical questions in a broader context.
I learned how to construct clear and logical arguments, critically analyze philosophical texts, and apply abstract reasoning to real-world and hypothetical situations. The course emphasized identifying assumptions, evaluating ethical perspectives, and articulating well-reasoned positions in both written and verbal form.

							<h2>Introduction to Academic Writing</h2>
							<p>
							This course focused on critical thinking, research, and argumentation in academic writing. Students learned how to develop effective rhetorical strategies, analyze audiences, and build structured, evidence-based arguments. The curriculum covered citation styles (MLA), visual rhetoric, and persuasive writing techniques. I developed advanced writing skills including thesis development, source integration, and rhetorical analysis. I also practiced evaluating credibility of sources, conducting scholarly research, and using multimedia tools to support arguments. The course reinforced clarity, organization, and precision in both written and visual communication.

							<h2>IDS Electronic Portfolio Project</h2>
							<p>My time at Old Dominion University has been a transformative experience, both academically and personally. As a cybersecurity major, I have had the opportunity to explore interdisciplinary connections between technology, law, ethics, and communication. What I valued most from my program was learning how to think critically about digital security problems while understanding their social and legal implications. Courses like Cyber Law (CYSE/CRJS 406), Introduction to Philosophy (PHIL 110P), and Academic Writing (ENGL 211C) helped me build a strong foundation in analytical reasoning, ethical awareness, and effective communication—skills that are essential in the cybersecurity field.
							One of the most valuable learning experiences at ODU was understanding how cybersecurity intersects with legal and ethical systems. In Cyber Law, I explored how the Fourth Amendment applies in digital spaces, how to interpret federal statutes like the CFAA, and how international law addresses cyberwarfare. These lessons not only taught me legal content but also how to think critically across disciplines—blending law, ethics, and technology.

Throughout my academic journey, I faced challenges such as adapting to remote learning during the pandemic, balancing coursework with personal responsibilities, and mastering technical material that required self-discipline and persistence. I learned to manage these obstacles by improving my time management, reaching out to instructors, and leaning on collaborative work where available.
My previous courses played a big role in helping me complete this program. For example, ENGL 211C strengthened my writing skills, which helped me articulate technical and legal concepts clearly in later courses. Philosophy taught me how to build strong arguments, which came in handy when evaluating ethical dilemmas in cybersecurity. My portfolio includes examples of essays and projects that reflect these connections, such as my legal case analysis from CYSE/CRJS 406.
								IDS 493 is a capstone course that helps students reflect on their academic journey and synthesize what they’ve learned across disciplines. The course emphasizes designing a professional portfolio that highlights skills, accomplishments, and interdisciplinary thinking.
The most valuable concept I learned in IDS 493 was how to present myself professionally through digital design and reflective writing. I learned how to frame my academic work in a way that communicates both depth of knowledge and career readiness. I’m particularly proud of the structure and clarity of my course reflections, especially how I linked coursework to real-world skills in law and cybersecurity.
If someone were to look at only one piece of my portfolio, I would point them to my Cyber Law reflection. It demonstrates how deeply I engaged with legal and ethical issues in cybersecurity and shows how I applied interdisciplinary thinking to real scenarios.
One of the challenges I faced in IDS 493 was organizing content across multiple courses in a cohesive way. It was difficult at first to see the “bigger picture” of how all my coursework connected. I addressed this by re-reading old assignments and reflecting on common themes such as ethics, communication, and policy. If I had more time, I would continue refining the visual layout of my portfolio and possibly add multimedia content like a short video introduction.
Previous coursework helped a lot. My writing courses taught me how to revise drafts, Philosophy helped me reflect more meaningfully, and my cybersecurity courses gave me technical credibility.
								Through this program, I’ve learned how interdisciplinary methods—blending law, ethics, technology, and communication—enhance my understanding of complex cybersecurity issues. The connections between philosophy, law, and writing helped me become a more effective and thoughtful professional. Being an interdisciplinary thinker is essential in cybersecurity because threats aren’t just technical—they’re legal, ethical, and social too.
After ODU, I plan to pursue a career in cybersecurity, possibly in digital forensics or policy analysis. I hope to continue integrating technical skills with broader legal and ethical understanding, making meaningful contributions to the field.
